### **Overview**

The MyAngularChallenge project is an Angular application designed to demonstrate development, reusability, and standalone component architecture. The application includes user authentication, data management, and role-based access control.

### **Key Functionalities:**

- Role-Based Dashboard:

  - Users: After logging in, regular users are redirected to a dashboard where they can view only their own posts.
  - Admins: Admin users are redirected to an admin dashboard where they can view and manage all posts across the system.

- Posts Management:
    - Posts are displayed dynamically based on the user's role.
    - Users see a list of their posts, while admins see all posts in the system.

- Authentication and Navigation:
   - Users are required to log in to access their dashboards.
   - Admin and user dashboards are secured with role-based route guards to prevent unauthorized access.

- Error Handling:
   - If an unauthorized user attempts to access restricted areas, they are redirected to an Access Denied page.

### **Routes**

| Route            | Component | Description             |
|---------------------|--------|-------------------------|
| `/login`           | LoginComponent    | Login page         |
| `/admin`       | AdminComponent    | Admin dashboard       |
| `/admin/settings`      | SettingsComponent   | Admin settings (child route)   |
| `/user`     | UserPostsComponent   | User dashboard       |
| `/logout`   | LogoutComponent   | Logout with dropdown |
| `access-denied` | AccessDeniedComponent | Access denied page |
| **          | Redirect to /login | Default fallback |
